TIMING-6#1 Critical Warning
No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks clk_out1_design_MicroBlaze_Fnd_clk_wiz_1_0 and clk_out1_design_MicroBlaze_Fnd_clk_wiz_1_0_1 are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks clk_out1_design_MicroBlaze_Fnd_clk_wiz_1_0] -to [get_clocks clk_out1_design_MicroBlaze_Fnd_clk_wiz_1_0_1]
